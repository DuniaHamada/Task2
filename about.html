        <h1>  KFC </h1>
        <p>KFC Corporation,
             doing business as Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC),
              is an American fast food restaurant chain headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky,
               that specializes in fried chicken.
                It is the world's second-largest restaurant chain (as measured by sales) after McDonald's, 
                with 22,621 locations globally in 150 countries as of December 2019. The chain is a subsidiary of Yum! Brands, 
                a restaurant company that also owns the Pizza Hut and Taco Bell chains.
                KFC was founded by Colonel Harland Sanders (1890â€“1980),
                 an entrepreneur who began selling fried chicken from his roadside restaurant in Corbin,
                  Kentucky, during the Great Depression.
                   Sanders identified the potential of the restaurant franchising concept and the first "Kentucky Fried Chicken" franchise opened in Salt Lake City, 
                   Utah in 1952. KFC popularized chicken in the fast-food industry,
                    diversifying the market by challenging the established dominance of the hamburger. </p>
